# dscrnsit.github.io

## Usage

- Fork repository and clone it locally
- Customize the content inside the following files only `index.html`, `learn.html`, `project.html` & `manifest.json`
- Raise Pull Request, which will be verified and merged (Please add a screenshot highlighting the changes you've made in website, if possible).

## Updating

Here is a git workflow for updating your fork (or downloaded copy) to the latest version:

```git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/dscrnsit/dscrnsit.github.io.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/dscrnsit.github.io
# resolve the merge conflicts in your editor
git add . -u
git commit -m 'Updated to the latest version'
```

## Using GitHub Issues

- Feel free to use GitHub issues for questions, bug reports, and feature requests
- Use the search feature to check for an existing issue
- Include as much information as possible and provide any relevant resources (Eg. screenshots)
- For bug reports ensure you have a reproducible test case
  - A pull request with a breaking test would be super preferable here but isn't required
