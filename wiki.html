            <h2>Important Tips for Engineering Years</h2>
            <h3 id="firstyear">First Year</h3>
            <p>
              Start by exploring the field. The technology domain is very vast
              and has a wide variety of options. The first 2 years of your
              engineering years should be exploring the options that this field
              provides (Not a hard and fast rule, but this time period should be
              adequate enough for you to find something of your interest). In
              future, you wouldn't want to end up doing something that you don't
              like, have no interest in or simply have no knowledge about. Take
              it easy and Network with as many people as possible. Knowing your
              seniors is very important.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 id="secondyear">Second Year</h3>
            <p>
              Befriend most of the teachers in your department. Try interning at
              reputed institutions like IIScs, IITs or at startups. Wouldn't
              recommend interning at large established companies. They dull you
              down, and above all you wouldn't have done anything worthwhile to
              add to your resume. While you are not interning, try reading on
              google scholar - the latest papers on your field of interest and
              publish your own in high impact journals like Springer.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 id="thirdyear">Third Year</h3>
            <p>Internships > Projects > Certifications</p>
            <p>
              If you're not able to secure internships, try doing projects on
              the domain you're interested in or in any domain. Mind you, these
              preferably should be personal projects and not academic (the ones
              you do during your semester). Certifications from Udemy are pretty
              much worthless. Certifications of courses that are offered by big
              universities (Stanford, Harvard, Cornell etc) are much more
              valuable. Else, instead of doing an application based capstone
              project, take up research projects. Most unis have PhD profs who
              would be more than happy to involve interested students. Make that
              your undergraduate thesis. Grades, open source profile, papers and
              UG thesis can help you get into merit heavy colleges like CMU,
              Caltech, USC etc. Not only do they help you get good colleges they
              also help you land better jobs.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 id="finalyear">Final Year</h3>
            <p>
              Higher studies may be pursued either abroad or in India in
              engineering or management streams. Getting admission for post
              graduation in India is very difficult due to tough competition
              compared to abroad admissions. However, if one aims to get
              admission into top ranking institutes, he /she must ensure
              initially whether they have good percentile of marks/CGPA in
              graduation. Preparation of good “Statement of Purpose” explaining
              the reasons clearly, why he/she wishes to pursue higher education
              is very important. The students should also take recommendation
              letters from their professors and keep them ready for submission
              when applying for Admissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              If getting good campus placement is your target, then efforts must
              be put right from day one of final year. Students targeting at
              core jobs should have sound knowledge of fundamentals of their
              branches. Students targeting software jobs should be good at soft
              skills and programming. If target is to get an opening in a multi
              national company, then learning a foreign language would be very
              much helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Attending mock group discussions and mock interviews would do lot
              of good in their preparation for campus interviews. Dress code,
              body language and time discipline will all be closely watched by
              the HR officials during selection process. Resume preparation is
              very vital and preparation of answers to typical questions like
              “tell me about yourself” is very important.
            </p>
            <p>
              Majority of campus placements particularly in IT companies will
              begin after seventh semester, as the IT body NASSCOM’s had urged
              all its members and colleges not to commence campus recruitments
              before the end of seventh semester. During the campus placements,
              students should submit their resumes with latest photograph
              against any job notification to the placement office within
              stipulated deadline. Before interviews, study about the company by
              going through their websites and interacting with alumni working
              in similar organizations.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h3 id="generaladvice">General Advice</h3>
            <p>
              Try things in life outside studies (I know you want to get into
              google and the 1 crore salary but being a nerd doesn't get you a
              life, a dating life and a confident life. Participate in societies
              that interest you theatre, comedy, music everything try new stuff,
              this will make you really confident moving forward and maybe you
              will get a new career choice, its not that hard in today's YouTube
              era)
            </p>
            <p>
              TV series and movie competitions between friends is cool but
              hampers you in final years when you have to focus on studies, try
              to get that sweet balance spot between studies and fun early on if
              you miss out on that you might easily become a slave to the laptop
              or mobile screen soon. Keep your GPA above 8 at least. As long as
              you take exams seriously it's not difficult. Specially try to do
              well in the early years as it generally gets more difficult in
              3rd/4th year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Get serious about learning skills and getting internships. Join
              Internshala / Letsintern early on. You can join marketing/writing
              internships right from first Summer and learn some new programming
              language/framework during Winter. You can often get research
              internships by mailing professors from geographically closer
              colleges. Starting mailing them after you have some experience
              from projects/interns. Learn Latex(overleaf) , design your resume
              using an overleaf template.
            </p>
            <p>
              Decide what you want to do after Undergrad by 2nd/3rd year and
              start working towards that. A graduate degree from North America
              can be greatly beneficial. But you need to start working on
              building a profile early on. M.Tech from top Indian schools can be
              worth it specially if you can get in right after Undergrad. Some
              work experience would help in Masters and Research internship
              towards PHD.

                <h4>Samsung Interview Experience for Internship</h4>

                <p>
                  Samsung had come on-campus for a 2021 summer internship in
                  SRIB, Bangalore. The CGPA cut-off was 7.5. There were three
                  rounds in the hiring process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Round 1 (Coding round):</strong> The coding was
                  conducted on Cocubes platform and there were three simple
                  questions. I do not remember the exact questions but there
                  were one DP question and the question of one tree which were
                  of easy level. I think the shortlist was based on how fast we
                  have solved and how efficient our solution is. So submit as
                  soon as you have coded the solution even you have time but
                  make sure your solution is the most efficient. 24 people were
                  shortlisted for the technical interview.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Round 2 (Technical interview):</strong> The interview
                  was on Skype. The questions asked were
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
                  <li>
                    Tell me about an interesting project you have done and the
                    challenges you had faced.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Given an array, find if there exists a triple a, b, c such
                    that a + b = c.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <a
                      href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-palindrome-substring-set-1/"
                    >
                      Longest palindromic substring.</a
                    >
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  I have given brute force, hashmap, and two-pointer solutions
                  for the first question. He asked me to code the two-pointer
                  solution and I had done that. For the second question, I gave
                  him the brute force and DP approach. He asked me if I can
                  optimize it and I have given him a solution with O(1) space
                  complexity. He then asked me to write the pseudo-code for that
                  solution and I have done that. He was satisfied with my
                  answers.
                  <br />
                  15 out of 24 were shortlisted for the next round.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Round 3 (Technical interview):</strong> This round was
                  also on Skype. The questions asked were
                </p>
                <ul class="text-reset text-decoration-none">
                  <li class="text-reset text-decoration-none">

                    Few in-depth questions from an ML project (Neural Machine
                    Translation) I have done.

                  <li>What is MySQL?</li>
                  <li>What is a pointer? Why do we use them?</li>
                  <li>What is a function pointer?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  He gave me a few print statements related to pointers and
                  asked me for the output. Something like
                  <a
                    href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointers-in-c-and-c-set-1-introduction-arithmetic-and-array/"

                    >Implement two stacks using one array</a
                  >. He had asked me to code it and I did that.
                  <br />
                  The entire interview was mostly based on CS fundamentals. They
                  had asked KMP algorithm, OOPS concepts, questions on ML, and a
                  few puzzles for other shortlisted people. 9 students were
                  finally selected, and I was one of them.
